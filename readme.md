# **Blades in the Falling Dawn**

*A Samurai Epic*

## **Chapter 1 – The Ronin’s Path**

The cicadas screamed in the tall grass, their shrill chorus rolling across the empty rice fields like a storm that never broke. Summer in Kai Province was thick with heat, and yet a lone figure moved steadily along the dirt road. His straw hat shaded his eyes, though it could not hide the lines carved deep into his face, nor the heavy silence that clung to his steps.

This was **Hattori Renjirō**, once a samurai of the Takeda clan. Now he bore no crest, no banner, only the two blades at his side — the katana and wakizashi that were both his honor and his burden. For three years he had wandered as a **rōnin**, masterless and without purpose, surviving by sword and coin, haunted by the ashes of battles lost.

Renjirō’s hand often brushed the hilt of his katana as though reminding himself it was still there. It was not paranoia that stirred him; it was memory. He had fought at the Battle of Nagashino, when the Takeda cavalry was torn apart by Oda Nobunaga’s muskets. He had lived through the slaughter, but survival had felt like betrayal. His lord had perished, his comrades buried in a field of gunpowder and blood. Since then, the road had been his only master.

That evening, as the sun sank behind the jagged peaks, Renjirō came upon a village nestled against a slow river. Smoke curled from chimneys, and children ran barefoot between huts. Yet beneath the humble surface lingered a tension he could feel as keenly as the weight of his sword. The villagers’ eyes darted toward him with unease, but not because he was a stranger. Their fear was older, deeper.

At the inn, a weathered man served him rice and pickled radish. Renjirō ate in silence until he asked, “This village… why do the people watch the road so closely?”

The innkeeper hesitated. His hands trembled as he poured sake. “Bandits,” he whispered. “They come down from the hills. Three times this month already. They take rice, coin, sometimes worse. We’ve sent word for help, but no lord answers our plea.”

Renjirō’s jaw tightened. Such tales were common in these fractured times. With the great clans locked in war, the land fractured into chaos, leaving farmers and townsfolk prey to blades with no honor.

The innkeeper leaned closer. “You carry swords. Perhaps… perhaps you could—”

Renjirō cut him off with a wave of his hand. “I am no lord’s retainer. Your struggle is not mine.”

And yet, that night, as he lay awake on the tatami mat, Renjirō could not close his eyes. In his dreams he saw again the battlefield of Nagashino: men crying out for their mothers as they fell, horses pierced by lead, banners sinking in the mud. His lord’s voice echoed in his ears: *Protect the people, even unto death.*

When dawn came, Renjirō stepped outside to find villagers gathered in the square. A girl no older than twelve clutched her mother’s sleeve, asking why no one would stop the bandits. The mother had no answer.

Renjirō adjusted the cords of his straw hat. He had sworn to walk without ties, to abandon the illusions of duty. But the weight of his swords seemed heavier that morning, as though they themselves whispered of honor yet unfulfilled.

At last he spoke: “Show me the road the bandits take.”

That afternoon, Renjirō stood at the edge of the fields where the road bent toward the hills. The villagers watched from afar, too fearful to come close. He planted himself in the middle of the path, hat low, one hand resting on his sword. Hours passed. The sun bled into the horizon.

Then he heard them — hooves and rough laughter. Five men appeared, clad in mismatched armor, spears across their shoulders. Their leader, a scarred brute with a wolfskin cloak, grinned at the lone samurai blocking the way.

“Out of the road, traveler,” the bandit growled. “Unless you mean to donate your coin and your head.”

Renjirō did not move. His voice was calm, almost weary. “Turn back. The people of this village have nothing left for you to steal.”

The bandits roared with laughter. “And who are you to order us, old dog?” the leader spat.

Renjirō’s hand slid to the hilt of his katana. For a breath, the world grew still — cicadas silenced, the river hushed. Then steel whispered free of its scabbard.

The fight was over before the villagers could cry out. Renjirō’s blade moved like water, swift and merciless. One bandit fell clutching his throat, another’s spear was cut in two, his chest opened by a single strike. The leader charged with a roar, swinging his heavy blade — but Renjirō stepped aside, cutting upward in a flash that severed the man’s arm.

The survivors fled, stumbling into the dusk. Renjirō sheathed his sword slowly, blood dripping into the dirt.

Behind him, the villagers emerged, eyes wide with awe and terror. The little girl bowed deeply, tears in her eyes. “Samurai-sama… you saved us.”

Renjirō shook his head. “I am no samurai,” he murmured. Yet in their eyes he saw something he had not seen in years: hope.

As he turned to leave, the innkeeper called after him. “Stay, please. If you protect us, we will give what we can. You would be our guardian.”

Renjirō hesitated. He had vowed never again to bind himself to duty, never again to wear the mask of honor. But as the wind rustled through the fields, carrying the voices of those he had once sworn to protect, he knew his path was changing.

The road of the rōnin had led him here, to this forgotten village. And here, perhaps, his sword would find purpose once more.
